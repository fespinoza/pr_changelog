- GitHub: LoginEntryView refinements (#499)
  * Replace layoutMargin constraints for edge constraints + constants
   Because the layoutMargin constraints don't work on iOS10

  * Favor the `configure(for:)` method for views in `LoginEntryView`

  * Add settings button to the `LoginEntryView`

  * Replace LoginEntryDemoView by a view controller
   As the login entry view will be used in the context of full screen view
  controllers with a tabBar, I'm trying to replicate the usage as close as
  possible to ensure testing done in FinniversKit will reflect the behavior in
  the Finn app.

  * Only show settings button in LoginEntryView if the view model says so

  * Refine constraints

  * Update reference image for the LoginEntryView

  * Fix layout for the messaging tab

  * SettingsView determines which element is the last one in the section
   Instead of that data coming from the view model. Because the data source will
   always know which item is the last one in the section, then it should
  configure the cell accordingly instead of setting this through the view model


  * Allow `SettingsViewDelegate` to set a footer view
